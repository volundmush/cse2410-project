If you're running this on Windows, you need to install the ms build tools for Visual Studio C++ using the ms build installer in order for the amulet library to build.

You also need a TIF file such as the one available from here: https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/65c46ee7d34ef4b119caec03

At present, you gotta modify run.py with the paths.
